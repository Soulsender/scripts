# bash-scripts

A repository for some custom-made bash scripts for my system, as well as some ones I've made for the community.

### What does it include?
- Alfa AWUS036ACH USB Network Adapter driver install.
- Wifi drivers for my own personal internat wireless cards.
- A script to install a bunch of tools I like because I distrohop sometimes.
- A update script for another one of my projects.

### Disclaimer
***I do not take any responsibility should this script damage your system. Use at your own risk. You should know roughly what a superuser script is doing on your computer. I am just an idiot that has fun with linux :).***
